        "I Was tasked with integrating the OpenAI API for this project. However, upon attempting to use the API, I encountered access restrictions due to the paid nature of the service and was unable to obtain the necessary API key. Given these constraints, I proceeded with an alternative technique that involved utilizing Pinecone for vector indexing and Hugging Face's RoBERTa model for question answering. This approach allows me to generate vector embeddings for questions and store them in Pinecone, which is then queried to retrieve the most relevant answer.\n",
